## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `ViewPatientBox` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Archive-related features

**How**<br>

![image](images/ArchiveCommandLogic.png)

After `Logic` component receives the instruction from `Ui` component, the `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser`
which correctly identifies that the `ArchiveCommand` is needed in the current situation. The `ArchiveCommandParser`
checks the arguments and then creates an `ArchiveCommand` object. Next, the archiving mechanism is facilitated by the
`ArchiveCommand` object which extends `Command`. It overrides `Command#execute` in order to return
a `CommandResult` with a success message stating that the command has been successfully executed. Then, the patient to
be archived is correctly identified from the index provided and passed to the `Model` component from the `Logic`
component. The `UnarchiveCommand` works similar to the implementation of the `ArchiveCommand`.

![image](images/ArchiveCommandModel.png)

The indicator for whether a patient is archived is implemented as a boolean in the `Patient` class. Therefore, when the
`ArchiveCommand` is executed, `Model` component receives the instruction and patient to be archived from `Logic`.
Then, the `UniquePersonList` in the `AddressBook` is accessed through the `ModelManager` and the specified patient is
archived by removing them from the list, changing their `isArchived` status to true and then adding them back to the
`UniquePersonList`. The `UnarchiveCommand` works similarly except for changing the `isArchived` to false.

**Why**<br>
It was implemented in this way in order to make it easier to use the `Model#updateFilteredPersonList` in order to
display all archived patients using a suitable predicate when the `ArchiveListCommand` is called just like how the
original `ListCommand` works. Moreover, the existing `DeleteCommand` and `FindCommand` could be used with the
archived list just like how they worked with the main list.

Another possible implementation was to create 2 `UniquePersonList` objects in AddressBook, one for the main list and
one for the archived list. However, this idea was scrapped as that would involve more changes throughout the component
and involve changes in unrelated classes. This way, the changes were contained and it made more sense for the `Patient`
object to contain the information of whether or not they were archived.

### Viewing all information regarding a patient

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `executeCommand("view 1")` API call.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48408342/114147903-c3b5ca80-994b-11eb-9bf3-add78bd3fca7.png)

**How**

The viewing mechanism is facilitated by the `ViewPatientCommand` which extends `Command`. It mainly overrides `Command#execute` in order to return a `CommandResult` with a `Patient` attribute. When `MainWindow#executeCommand` is ran:
1. The command is parsed into a `CommandResult` by the `LogicManager` and passed into `MainWindow#processResult`.
2. The `CommandResult` will then trigger `MainWindow#handlePatientViewBox` since it has a patient.
3. `MainWindow#handlePatientViewBox` handles the construction of the `StackPane` containing all the patient information. It clears the `viewPatienBoxPlaceholder` in case there are Javafx nodes from the previous patient, and adds a new `ViewPatientBox` to it.
4. The constructor of `ViewPatientBox` takes in a `Person` object and extracts information such as their name, phone, address, email, tags, appointments and medical records and adds the information to the labels and Panes which will be displayed in the `ViewPatientBox` UI.

**Why**

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `processResult(CommandResult)` API call.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48408342/114144410-e47c2100-9947-11eb-895f-afd00657b5af.png)

Since `MainWindow#processResult` dictates what to show on the UI depending on the `CommandResult` as seen above, we can easily allow `MainWindow#processResult` to call `MainWindow#handlePatientViewBox` 
when it detects that a patient is present in `CommandResult`. `MainWindow#handlePatientViewBox` can then simply contruct the `StackPane` containing the patient's information.

### Creating an appointment for a patient

The implementation of creating an appointment borrows from the implementation of the `EditCommand`, since adding an appointment can be viewed as editing a patient with a new list of appointments
which includes the new appointment to be added. This avoids unnecessary repetition of implementation code.

Note: Whenever the appointments of a patient is requested, we look through the list to delete appointments that are more than a day old. 

### Creating/viewing a medical record of a patient 

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `executeCommand("mrec 1")` API call. The interactions for creating a 
medical record are similar to those for viewing one, which will not be elaborated on here. 

**How**

The creation of a medical record is facilitated by the `OpenMedicalRecordCommand` while viewing is facilitated by `ViewMedicalRecordCommand`, 
both of which extend `Command`. Both commands inform `MainWindow` to open a separate secondary window for the editing/viewing of the medical record. When `MainWindow#executeCommand` is ran:
1. The command is parsed into a `CommandResult` by the `LogicManager` and passed into `MainWindow#processResult`.
2. The `CommandResult` will then trigger `MainWindow#handleEdit` which tells `MainWindow` to create a separate `EditorWindow` for creating/viewing the medical record.
3. `EditorWindow` handles the construction of the new window for editing/viewing the medical record. If appropriate, such as when creating a new medical record, it allows editing of the relevant text fields
4. If the medical record has been saved, `EditorWindow` itself will create a relevant `SaveMedicalRecordCommand`
5. `EditorWindow` itself has a copy of the `commandExecutor` passed by `MainWindow`, and will execute the `SaveMedicalRecordCommand` created to save the medical record under the relevant
patient.

**Why**

One of the core functionalities of this feature is to allow usage of other commands in the `MainWindow` even while the `EditorWindow` containing the medical record is open. To facilitate this,
we give the `EditorWindow` a copy of the `MainWindow#executeCommand` method during its creation, so that after opening the record, saving can be initiated anytime by the `EditorWindow`
(but still handled by `MainWindow`) while the `MainWindow` resumes its role in the parsing and execution of commands.

In this way, the opening and saving of medical records is decoupled, allowing multiple records to be opened before one is closed, and there is no strict time dependency between the commands.
